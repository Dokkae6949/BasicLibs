# Basic Libs
 I created this library because I wanted to have a place where I can and will store every <br /> 
 library I will every make (at least in my school carrer :] ) <br /> 
 But I hope that some of you may find some usefull stuff in my spaghetti code. <br /><br />
 Thats it and have fun <br /><br />
